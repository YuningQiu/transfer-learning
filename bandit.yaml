# B301 - dill usage scoope is different from what's described in CWE-502
#        dill is mostly used used for dumping/saving models to disk(serialization)
#        When loading previously saved models from disk(descerialization),
#        either Keras model loader or PyTorch loader used first to verify the model,
#        and then create a copy to be passed to dill for loading.
# B311 - random usage scope is different from what's described in CWE-330
# B403 - this one is reported everytime 'dill' is imported, so it's actually covered by B301 justification
# B404 - this one is reported everytime 'subprocess' is imported but this modules is not used as described in CWE-78
