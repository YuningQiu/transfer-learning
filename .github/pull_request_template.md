<!-- Add a description of the changes made in the PR -->

**Before requesting a review:**

- [ ] I have ensured my PR title is accurate
- [ ] I wrote a description of the changes being made, if it's not obvious
- [ ] I have synced by branch with the base (i.e. `develop`)
- [ ] I ran `make lint` on my branch and it passes
- [ ] I ran the pytest tests that could reasonably be affected by my changes and they pass
- [ ] I have performed a self code review of my own code on the "Files changed" tab of the pull request
- [ ] I have commented my code in hard-to-understand areas
- [ ] I have updated the documentation (in docstrings, notebooks, and .rst files)
- [ ] I have added new tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works (or provide justification why not)
- [ ] I have applied the appropriate labels to the PR (if your PR is not ready for review use "WIP")
